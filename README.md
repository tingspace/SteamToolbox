# Steam Toolbox

A set of tools & libraries I use for some fun stuff.

Everything is still work in progress. Don't expect a polished experience.

Current tools:

| Tool Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| MatchingSteamGames | CLI that prompts for Profile URLs and lists the games owned by both Profiles |
